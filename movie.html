      <p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamma_Mia!_(film)" target="_blank" title="about mammamia1 film">Mamma Mia!</a></strong> (promoted as Mamma Mia! The Movie) is a 2008 jukebox musical romantic comedy film directed
        by
        Phyllida Lloyd
        and written by
        Catherine
        Johnson based
        on the 1999 musical of the same name, also written by Johnson, which
        itself is based on the songs of pop group ABBA, including the title song, with additional music composed by ABBA member Benny Andersson. The film features an ensemble cast, including Christine Baranski, Pierce Brosnan, Dominic Cooper, Colin
        Firth,
        Amanda Seyfried, Stellan Skarsgård, Meryl Streep and Julie Walters. The plot follows a young bride-to-be who invites three men to her upcoming wedding, each one with the possibility of being her father. The film was an international
        co-production
        between Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States, and was co-produced by Relativity Media, Playtone and Littlestar Productions.</p>
      <p>Principal photography primarily took place on the island of Skopelos, Greece from August to September
        2007.
        The film was distributed by Universal Pictures. Mamma Mia! held its world premiere on June 30, 2008 at Leicester Square in London and premiered on July 4, 2008 in Stockholm, Sweden, with Andersson, Björn Ulvaeus, Anni-Frid Lyngstad and
        Agnetha
        Fältskog in attendance. The film was released theatrically on July 10 in the United Kingdom, on July 17 in Germany and on July 18 in the United States. It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the musical numbers and production
        values,
        but criticized the plot and casting of inexperienced singers, in particular Brosnan and Skarsgård. Nonetheless, the film was popular with audiences and grossed $615 million worldwide on a $52 million budget, becoming the fifth
        highest-grossing
        film of 2008. A sequel, titled Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again, was released on July 20, 2018 with most of the main cast returning.</p>
